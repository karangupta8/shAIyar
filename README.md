## Project Description
ShAIyar is an assistant designed to enhance the reading experience of literature, particularly poetry, for bilingual individuals. The application ingests literature and provides transliteration, translation, and explanation of difficult words. It makes it easy to enjoy content originally created in languages the user is not proficient in.

The name "ShAIyar" combines "Shayar," the Urdu/Hindi word for "poet," with "AI" (Artificial Intelligence).

## Inspiration
In May’2025, I decided to read a classic Hindi poetry book, Madhushala. It was published in 1935 and is written by the iconic Harivansh Rai Bachchan. Even though Hindi is my second native language, my Hindi vocabulary wasn't so efficient to read this book smoothly especially when its language is relatively archaic for Today. I had to constantly Google words while reading which impended to trule enjoy the read. Moreover, its difficult to search Hindi words as I don't know how to type in Devanagari script.
I did not find any appropriate translations of the book online. However, I did find its digital copy in Public Domain. So I had an idea to translate it myself while maintaining the original essence as much as possible. I could then get this personlized translation printed out and read it effortlessly.

## 🧑‍🎓 Ideal Users

For individuals who straddle two languages — fluent in one, aspiring in another — and are eager to engage with literature that lies just beyond their linguistic comfort zone.

- 🔄 **Bilingual Readers**: Individuals with strong (C1–C2) proficiency in one language and intermediate (B1–B2) in another, seeking to explore literature in their less dominant language.
- 🌍 **Diaspora Communities**: People reconnecting with their heritage through classical texts in native scripts they may not read fluently.
- 📚 **Students & Scholars**: Those studying poetry, translation, culture, or linguistics who require deeper insights into poetic and contextual nuances.
- 🧠 **Curious Explorers**: Anyone passionate about poetry but hindered by script unfamiliarity or vocabulary gaps.

ShAIyar aims to bridge the gap between literary appreciation and linguistic confidence.

## Sample System Prompt, Input and Output

You are a scholar in Hindi Poetry with as well as English literature

For any Hindi poems I submit, provide:
For each line:
1. Give the Hindi line. Include meanings of key Hindi words in the same line (in brackets or inline).
2. Give the English translation.
3. Briefly explain the line in English.
Keep it short and structured.

### For Example

### Input:

मुख से तू अविरत कहता जा — मधु, मदिरा, मादक हाला।
हाथों में अनुभव करता जा — एक ललित कल्पित प्याला।
ध्यान किए जा मन में सुमधुर, सुखकर, सुंदर साक़ी का
और बढ़ा चल, पथिक, न तुझको दूर लगेगी मधुशाला।।


### Output:
मुख से तू अविरत कहता जा मधु,

## Advantage of Using LLM vs Traditional Translation Methods

### 1. Difficulty Assessment
- **LLM Capability**: Assess the difficulty level of each poem or individual word based on context and user familiarity.
- **Advantage**: Prioritizes the explanation of more complex parts, helping users focus their attention effectively.

### 2. Contextual Explanation
- **LLM Capability**: Provide nuanced, context-aware meanings of difficult words and phrases.
- **Advantage**: Goes beyond dictionary definitions to incorporate poetic nuance, idiomatic use, and cultural relevance.

### 3. Style Adaptation
- **LLM Capability**: Translate while preserving the poem’s original tone, rhythm, and literary devices.
- **Advantage**: Maintains the artistic and emotional essence of the original, improving literary fidelity.

### 4. Content Generation
- **LLM Capability**: Generate summaries, analyses, or thematic breakdowns of each poem.
- **Advantage**: Aids in deeper understanding and academic engagement with the text.

## Success Metrics

- **Reduced time spent looking up word meanings**  
  Users spend less time consulting external dictionaries or reference materials.

- **Improved comprehension of the poetry**  
  Users demonstrate a better grasp of themes, imagery, and vocabulary.

- **Increased user satisfaction with the reading experience**  
  Higher engagement levels and positive feedback from readers using LLM-supported tools.



## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage


## Docker Usage

The recommended way to run this application is via Docker, which ensures that all dependencies and environment configurations are handled correctly.

### Prerequisites

- Docker must be installed on your system.

### 1. Building the Docker Image

First, build the Docker image from the project's root directory (where the `Dockerfile` is located).

```bash
docker build -t shaiyar-processor .
```

This command builds an image and tags (`-t`) it with the name `shaiyar-processor`.

### 2. Running the Container

To run the application, you need to use `docker run`. Since the script processes local files, you must mount a local directory into the container using a volume (`-v`). This allows the script inside the container to access your input files and save the output back to your machine.

**Example:**

Let's assume you have a directory named `data` in your project root for your input and output files.

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)/data:/code/data" shaiyar-processor \
  --input "data/my_document.docx" \
  --output "data/processed_document.docx" \
  --provider "openai" \
  --api-key "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" \
  --verbose
```

**Command Breakdown:**

- `docker run --rm`: Runs the container and automatically removes it once the script finishes.
- `-v "$(pwd)/data:/code/data"`: Mounts your local `data` directory into the `/code/data` directory inside the container. This is crucial for file access.
- `shaiyar-processor`: The name of the image to run.
- `--input "data/..."`, `--output "data/..."`, etc.: These are the command-line arguments passed directly to the Python script. Note that the file paths are relative to the container's working directory (`/code`).

> **Security Note**: For better security, avoid passing API keys directly as command-line arguments. Consider modifying the application to read keys from environment variables, which can be passed securely to the container using the `-e` flag (e.g., `-e "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key"`).


### Command Line Interface

```bash
# Basic usage with default configuration
python main.py

# Specify input and output files
python main.py --input "input.docx" --output "output.docx"

# Use different LLM provider
python main.py --provider openai --model "gpt-4" --api-key "your_key"

# Verbose logging
python main.py --verbose

# Use configuration file
python main.py --config config.yaml
```

### Programmatic Usage

```python
from config import Config
from shaiyar_processor import ShAIyarProcessor

# Create configuration
config = Config()
config.file_config.input_docx_path = "input.docx"
config.file_config.output_docx_path = "output.docx"
config.llm_config.api_key = "your_api_key"

# Process document
processor = ShAIyarProcessor(config)
success = processor.process()
```

## Configuration

The application supports configuration through:
- Code defaults
- Configuration files (YAML/JSON)
- Command line arguments

### Configuration Options
