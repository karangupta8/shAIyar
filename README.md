## Project Description
ShAIyar is an assistant designed to enhance the reading experience of literature, particularly poetry, for bilingual individuals. The application ingests literature and provides transliteration, translation, and explanation of difficult words. It makes it easy to enjoy content originally created in languages the user is not proficient in.

The name "ShAIyar" combines "Shayar," the Urdu/Hindi word for "poet," with "AI" (Artificial Intelligence).

## Inspiration
In May‚Äô2025, I decided to read a classic Hindi poetry book, Madhushala. It was published in 1935 and is written by the iconic Harivansh Rai Bachchan. Even though Hindi is my second native language, my Hindi vocabulary wasn't so efficient to read this book smoothly especially when its language is relatively archaic for Today. I had to constantly Google words while reading which impended to trule enjoy the read. Moreover, its difficult to search Hindi words as I don't know how to type in Devanagari script.
I did not find any appropriate translations of the book online. However, I did find its digital copy in Public Domain. So I had an idea to translate it myself while maintaining the original essence as much as possible. I could then get this personlized translation printed out and read it effortlessly.

## üßë‚Äçüéì Ideal Users

For individuals who straddle two languages ‚Äî fluent in one, aspiring in another ‚Äî and are eager to engage with literature that lies just beyond their linguistic comfort zone.

- üîÑ **Bilingual Readers**: Individuals with strong (C1‚ÄìC2) proficiency in one language and intermediate (B1‚ÄìB2) in another, seeking to explore literature in their less dominant language.
- üåç **Diaspora Communities**: People reconnecting with their heritage through classical texts in native scripts they may not read fluently.
- üìö **Students & Scholars**: Those studying poetry, translation, culture, or linguistics who require deeper insights into poetic and contextual nuances.
- üß† **Curious Explorers**: Anyone passionate about poetry but hindered by script unfamiliarity or vocabulary gaps.

ShAIyar aims to bridge the gap between literary appreciation and linguistic confidence.

## Advantage of Using LLM vs Traditional Translation Methods

### 1. Difficulty Assessment
- **LLM Capability**: Assess the difficulty level of each poem or individual word based on context and user familiarity.
- **Advantage**: Prioritizes the explanation of more complex parts, helping users focus their attention effectively.

### 2. Contextual Explanation
- **LLM Capability**: Provide nuanced, context-aware meanings of difficult words and phrases.
- **Advantage**: Goes beyond dictionary definitions to incorporate poetic nuance, idiomatic use, and cultural relevance.

### 3. Style Adaptation
- **LLM Capability**: Translate while preserving the poem‚Äôs original tone, rhythm, and literary devices.
- **Advantage**: Maintains the artistic and emotional essence of the original, improving literary fidelity.

### 4. Content Generation
- **LLM Capability**: Generate summaries, analyses, or thematic breakdowns of each poem.
- **Advantage**: Aids in deeper understanding and academic engagement with the text.

## Success Metrics

- **Reduced time spent looking up word meanings**  
  Users spend less time consulting external dictionaries or reference materials.

- **Improved comprehension of the poetry**  
  Users demonstrate a better grasp of themes, imagery, and vocabulary.

- **Increased user satisfaction with the reading experience**  
  Higher engagement levels and positive feedback from readers using LLM-supported tools.
